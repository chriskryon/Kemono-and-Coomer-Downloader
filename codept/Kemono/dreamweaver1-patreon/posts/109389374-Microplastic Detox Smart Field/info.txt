The detoxification process in the body involves several organs working together to eliminate toxins and maintain health. The liver is the main organ responsible for detoxification, where it transforms toxins into less harmful substances and makes them water-soluble for easier excretion.
This process occurs in three phases: transforming toxins, neutralizing them by attaching molecules, and moving the neutralized toxins into bile or urine for excretion. The kidneys also play a crucial role by filtering blood to remove waste and toxins, which are then excreted as urine. Additionally, the lungs help expel gases and volatile compounds, while the skin excretes toxins through sweat.
The gastrointestinal tract assists by binding toxins with fibre and excreting them through bile. The lymphatic system transports waste products and toxins from tissues to the bloodstream for elimination.
This is designed to target the new current build-up of microplastics and more effectively and efficiently remove it from your body.
You can naturally experience some detoxification illness in process of removal. 2 - 3 times or as needed. (per day)

I just read (new medical test results) that plastics play part in developing endometriosis, that especially one type is very big endo feeder. I´m battling with this disease, been drinking bottled water daily over 10 years, was using some pvc clothing too. Uh, i think i need to do some detoxing. I´m just scared to get herx because my body is very sensitive.
